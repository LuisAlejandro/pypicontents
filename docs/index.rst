PyPIContents is an application that generates a Module Index from the
Python Package Index (PyPI) and also from various versions of
the Python Standard Library.

PyPIContents generates a configurable index written in ``JSON`` format that
serves as a database for applications like `pipsalabim`_. It can be configured
to process only a range of packages (by initial letter) and to have
memory, time or log size limits. It basically aims to mimic what the
`Contents`_ file means for a Debian based package repository, but for the
Python Package Index.

This repository stores the application. The actual index lives in a `different
repository`_ and is rebuilt weekly via Github Actions.
